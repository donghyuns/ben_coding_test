Part 5: Problem-Solving Questions

Scenario 1: During a release cycle, you find that the number of bugs reported in the new
features is significantly higher than in the previous releases. The development team claims that
the features were developed according to specifications.
Task: Write a response detailing how you would handle this situation, including steps to identify
the root cause and possible solutions to reduce the number of bugs in future releases.

--> Bugs can be increased from various reasons.
    1) If the new feature are more complex and difficult to implement than the previous features, it's natural.
       We may have needed more time and need to improve the process of estimation.
    2) If the difficulty of the feature is similar to the previous, we need to review our release process and CI/CD pipeline to see any merge issue can happen.


Scenario 2: You are part of a QA team that is transitioning from manual to automated testing.
However, some team members are resistant to this change, citing a lack of experience in
programming.
Task: Describe how you would address this challenge to ensure a smooth transition to
automated testing while keeping the team motivated and engaged.

--> I would talk about our career path as a technical QA. If we agree on the technical QA, the next step is how to achieve it.
    We understand how difficult it is to transition to an automation QA. As a team, we can support together providing training, sharing knowledge,
    we don't be hurry for that, but we will continue to go with it and eventually we will get it.
