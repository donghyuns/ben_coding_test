Part 4: Performance Testing Scenario
Scenario: You are given a basic cloud service that is the entry point for our mobile app. This
service is responsible for signing up and signing in users and related helper functionalities. This
application is expected to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users during peak hours.
Task: Develop a performance testing plan outlining the following aspects:

Performance test Plan
1. Objectives
    - To verify if the system can manage 10,000 concurrent users when logging in under less than 2sce response time
    - To verify if the system can manage 10,000 concurrent log-ins
    - To monitor the system's CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage
2. Tool
    - It could be better to use LoadRunner because it provides detailed resource monitors and features that can merge different monitors into one.
      i.e. Can merge CPU usage graph with Response time graph, so that we can see if there's any bottleneck.
3. Test Cases
    - 9,800 users log in with 20 users ramp up in 30sec interval
    - 200 users sign up with 10 users ramp up in 60sec interval
    - Then 5,000 users are searching for different titles of books,
           4,000 users are viewing book details,
           1,000 users are adding to cart
    - Each transactions have 10sec think-time.
4. Metrics
    - Response time, CPU usage, Memory usage, Disk usage
    - Throughput
    - Network traffic (to check if there's any mis-configurations)
5. Test Environment
    - 1 test controller machine, several load generators
    - Use backbone network to reduce network bottleneck
    - Server configuration needs to the same as production or similar
    - Any cache off in network devices if necessary
    - Enough data needs to be stored in database
6. Analysis
    - Response time to see if it satisfies our requirement
    - To check the point that response time is increased
      if CPU/memory/disk usages are the same but only response time is increased, that could mean there's logic bottleneck.
